** Importing some python stuff
#+begin_src python
  import os, platform, subprocess
#+end_src

** First what about a friendly greeting? ;)
#+begin_src python
  username = subprocess.getoutput("whoami")
  print("Hello fellow", username,"I hope you're doing ok!")
#+end_src


** Some checks and balances are also important!
#+begin_src python

              ", unfortunately this script only supports archlinux ;(")
